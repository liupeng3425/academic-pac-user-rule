# Academic PAC user rule
Academic PAC user rule preventing academic websites proxied by VPNs.

## Why set academic websites in NO PROXY list?

The academic resources brought to you by your institution/universities, are usually identified by your IP. When you use a proxy to access these resources, the resource providers might not recognize your organization.

## How to use?
Append the content in the `academic user rule.txt` to your user rule config file.
